# Github Actions Demo
> Automating publishing of catacomb projects

This demo builds and publishes the [sentiment analysis](https://github.com/catacomb-ai/examples/tree/master/sentiment_classifier) catacomb example automatically on merge into master.

## Usage

Using this repo is pretty simple! Just merge in a PR or push to master. Then go to the [actions page](https://github.com/catacomb-ai/actions-demo/actions) and wait for the build to finish. Once the build finishes, there will be a url to finalize your deploy at. Click that and youre good to go!
